# Zoonosis_Text_Mining

This repository contains the code of my bachelor thesis. The link to the thesis will be added as soon as it is accepted.

Throghout my thesis I retrieved full texts of articles from the open access database PubMed Central and created a corpus for training purposes.
With this data a spaCy language model was updated, so it recognizes entities which are connected to the zoonotic virus rabies.
